# rcfiles

run

```bash
~/rcfiles/deploy_install.sh
```
for the full setup

If you can't install anything/don't have root, run
```bash
~/rcfiles/deploy_no_install.sh
```

These source from rcfiles, so just have to git pull to update to most recent configuration.

Have Fun!

There will be errors as you reload your setup until everything is installed

## Notes

zsh_zsh.sh is for zsh specific config
zsh_user.sh is for all user config

vim plug files have all the plugins

sourcers in subdirectories are meant to be in the home directory with the proper name per file
