# rcfiles

run

```bash
~/rcfiles/deploy_install.sh
```
for the full setup

If you can't install anything, run
```bash
~/rcfiles/deploy_no_install.sh
```

These source from rcfiles, so just have to git pull to update to most recent configuration.

Have Fun!

## Notes

zsh_zsh.sh is for zsh specific config
zsh_user.sh is for all user config

vim plug files have all the plugins

sourcers are meant to be in the home directory with the proper name per file
